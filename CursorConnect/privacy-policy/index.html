    <h1>Privacy Policy for CursorConnect</h1>
    <p>
        CursorConnect respects your privacy. The extension only processes data necessary for its core functionality. Specifically, the extension sends the absolute position of your cursor to a central server that we host. This server is open-source and designed to manage cursor data in a transparent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data sent to the server is not tied to any personal information. We do not collect or store any personal details, such as names or contact information. Each user is represented by an anonymized, unique identifier (UUID), ensuring that no tracking or identification of individual users takes place.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cursor position data is used solely for the functionality of the CursorConnect extension and is not shared, sold, or used for any other purpose beyond the scope of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not retain data longer than necessary for the extension to function properly. Any data stored temporarily is handled securely and with full respect for your privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our central server is open-source, allowing the public to review how data is managed and processed. This ensures complete transparency in how your data is handled.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions, concerns, or requests related to your data, you may contact us at any time. We are dedicated to addressing privacy concerns and ensuring your data remains secure.
